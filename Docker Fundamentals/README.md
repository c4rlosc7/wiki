<h2 style="color:#0652DD;">What is docker ? ðŸ™‚</h2>

**Docker** is a set of platform as a service **(PaaS)** products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files.

<h2 style="color:#0652DD;">What is a container?</h2>

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

<h2 style="color:#0652DD;">What does docker solve?</h2>

- Missing or incorrect application dependencies such as libraries, interpreters, code/binaries, users.
- Conflicts between programs running on the same computer such as library dependencies or ports.
- Compatibility of each service with the libraries and dependencies of OS.
- Build and ship any application anywhere.
